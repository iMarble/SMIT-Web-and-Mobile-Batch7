1- position     -> https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
There are 5 types of position properties in css:

a) static   
    -> default property (left, right, top, bottom properties don' work)

b) relative 
    -> move element from its exact location to other location
    -> It leaves a gap on it's origional location
    -> movement of this element doesn't effect other elements positions
    -> left, right, top, bottom properties work here

c) fixed
    -> move element according to the viewport
    -> It doesn't leave a gap on it's origional location
    -> movement of this element doesn't effect other elements positions
    -> left, right, top, bottom properties work here
    
d) absolute
c) sticky
